    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    //Array
    //BY reference
    const players2 = players;
    players2[0] = 'aaa';
    console.log(players);

    //By copy
    const players3 = players.slice();
    console.log(`Hello`+players3);
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    const players5 = [...players];
    const players6 = Array.from(players);

    //Object

    const ob1 = {
      name: `Utsav`,
      age: `49`,
      num: `20`
    };
    // Reference
    const ob2 = ob1;

    // Copy
    const ob3 = Object.assign({},ob1,{gender: `male`, num: `40`});
    console.log(ob3);
    const ob4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ob2));

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
